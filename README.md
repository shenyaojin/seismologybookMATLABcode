Wan's _Introduction to Seismology_. Answer and code.

# Difference between the origin one?

I edited the code into an English version, for there're some students have no Chinese font on their PC(such as me, I installed Chinese font while I'm learning seismlogy in ZJU), and have no MATLAB installed on their PC for various reasons(Lack of money, or insistance of open-source opinion).

# What I want to do later? 

1. Translate the code into English from all the chapter.
2. Rebuild the code in an Octave version. Test them to make true they could work on octave.
3. Add the code from the following chapter, not only chapter 1-4.

Note that I'm not going to translate the answer, for I'm a exploration seismology learner, I couldn't make sure the quality of answer of this book.
